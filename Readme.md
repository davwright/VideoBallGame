# Video Ball Game
A faithful reproduction of Electronic Australia's May 1975 ["Video Ball Game"](https://archive.org/details/EA1976/EA%201976-05%20May/page/n39/mode/2up).  
Thanks to the kind help of [Jon Stanley](https://www.electronixandmore.com/projects/pong/index.html), who also built this.  
This version includes Jon's 10MÎ© fix for the flipflop holding the ball's horizontal direction.

The files are [kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) schematics and PCB.
