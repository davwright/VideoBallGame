# Video Ball Game
A faithful reproduction of  May 1976 ["Video Ball Game"](https://archive.org/details/EA1976/EA%201976-05%20May/page/n39/mode/2up) by [Electronics Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_Australia) magazine.  
Thanks to the kind help of [Jon Stanley](https://www.electronixandmore.com/projects/pong/index.html), who also built this.  
This version includes Jon's 10MÎ© fix for the flipflop holding the ball's horizontal direction.
